# sharpDash
sharpDash is a C# porting of the famouse Javascript Lodash library.

For the documentation, you can use the official one provided by [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.2).

Today I'm supporting just few of its functions, only those that operate on Arrays. In particular, the supported functions are:

- chunk
- compact
- difference
- drop
- dropRight
- fill
- head
- indexOf
- initial
- intersect
- join
- last
- lastIndexOf
- nth
- pull
- pullAll
- pullAt
- reverse
- slice
- sortedIndex
- sortedLastIndex
- sortedLastIndexOf
- uniq
- sortedUniq
- tail
- take
- takeRight
- union
- without

More functions will be added in future.

I precise that this is a JUST-FOR-FUN project, so I will work on it only when I will not be too busy.

Enjoy!
