sharpDash is a C# porting of the famouse Javascript Lodash library.

For the documentation, you can use the official one provided by [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.2).

Today I'm supporting just few of its functions, only those that operate on Array and Collection. In particular, the supported functions are:

## Array:
- chunk
- compact
- concat
- difference
- differenceBy
- drop
- dropRight
- dropRightWhile
- fill
- first
- flatten
- flattenDeep
- flattenDepth
- head
- indexOf
- initial
- intersection
- intersectionBy
- join
- last
- lastIndexOf
- nth
- pull
- pullAll
- pullAt
- remove
- reverse
- slice
- sortedIndex
- sortedIndexOf
- sortedLastIndex
- sortedLastIndexOf
- sortedUniq
- tail
- take
- takeRight
- union
- unionBy
- uniq
- unzip
- without
- xor
- xorBy
- zip
- zipObject

## Collection:
- countBy (array only)
- filter
- find
- findLast
- includes

## Date:
- now


More functions will be added in future.

I precise that this is a JUST-FOR-FUN project, so I will work on it only when I will not be too busy.

Enjoy!
